# Codecool Quest

This is a simple tile-based RPG game.

## Opening the project

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA. This is a Maven project, so you will need to open `pom.xml`.

The project is using JavaFX, and should work with Oracle's Java 8.

## Implementation

Take a look at `user-stories.md` for a list of proposed user stories.
